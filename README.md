## Task 1: Dictionary of Student Marks

### Description
This task demonstrates the creation and querying of a dictionary in Python. The program creates a dictionary where student names are keys and their corresponding marks are the values. It then takes a student's name as input and returns their marks if they exist in the dictionary.

### Key Functionality
1. **Dictionary Creation**: A dictionary is created with predefined student names and their corresponding marks.
2. **User Input**: The program takes input from the user asking for a student's name.
3. **Dictionary Query**: The program checks if the input name exists in the dictionary.
4. **Output**: Depending on whether the name is found or not, the program prints the corresponding marks or an error message.

## Task 2: Demonstrate List Slicing

### Description
This task demonstrates list slicing and reversing in Python. The program creates a list of numbers from 1 to 10, extracts the first five elements using slicing, reverses the extracted elements, and prints both the original and reversed lists.

### Key Functionality
1. **List Creation**: A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created.
2. **List Slicing**: The first five elements of the list are extracted using slicing.
3. **Reversing List**: The `.reverse()` method is used to reverse the extracted list.
4. **Output**: The original list, the extracted first five elements, and the reversed extracted elements are printed.
